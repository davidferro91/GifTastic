Giphy Webpage using APIs

This is a webpage designed to generate the user's desired (and some creator's desired) GIFs, (or Graphics Interchange Format).  Now there is discussion on the pronounciation of "GIF", but given that the first letter stands for "graphics", it obviously should make a *cough choke* sound and be pronouned as "gif".

Anyways, the page uses the API from giphy.com to generate the gifs related to the topic of the user's choice.  The user can create new buttons easily by just typing in a topic into the search bar, and then click on the button to make the gifs.  The gifs will appear as still images, but once the user clicks on the image, the magic begins!

Normally, 10 gifs are created for each button, but if you need more Will Ferrell or Spock gifs than the ones that are there, just simply click on the button to create more!  Don't worry; the button will tell you the type of the gifs that you are making.

After about 30 seconds and furious clicking and laughter, you will probably have a page FULL of gifs, maybe more than you can handle.  No worries!  There's a clear option so you can start over with a clean slate.

If you have any questions about how the page works or need any clarification, feel free to email me at david-ferro@sbcglobal.net.

Thanks and enjoy!
